Instructions: create a new repository called ng-ds-test. Within this repo, create a README.md file. 
Copy and paste all of these questions into this README file and answer them. 


Name and describe the two main operations of a stack (to add and remove data). 


Name and describe the two main operations of a queue (to add and remove data). 


Draw the tree resulting from adding the following sequence of numbers to an empty tree: 30, 45, 15, 10, 50, 40, 20, 27 


Is this tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), 
or leftRotation(10)) 

Now add 29. Is the tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: 
rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10)) 

Consider the following tree: 
------5 
---2-----8 
-1--3 

Now add 0 to the tree. Which one is the first node to go out of balance? 

How do you fix this node? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10)) 

What are the four main steps of mergesort? 

Say you have a program which handles the login queue to a game server. The game server is able to log in one person every one second. Assume that one second must elapse after a person logs in with an empty queue before they are removed from the queue. Draw the state of the queue at 12:00:06, considering the following sequence of events: 
At 12:00:00 Hades logs in 
At 12:00:00 Ares logs in 
At 12:00:00 Zeus logs in 
At 12:00:00 Buzz Light Year logs in 
At 12:00:02 Kanye West logs in 
At 12:00:03 Taylor Swift logs in 
At 12:00:03 Darkwing Duck logs in 
At 12:00:04 Evil Mickey logs in.
